# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation
This project explores bitwise operators, which perform operations on bits one at a time.
**Bitwise operators include**:
- | (OR) operator, 1 if at least one operand is 1
- & (AND) operator, 1 if both operands are 1
- ^ (XOR) operator, 1 if one and only one operand is 1
- ~ (NOT) operator, negates the value of an operator
