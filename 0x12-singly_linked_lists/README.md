# 0x12.C - Singly linked lists
This project explores singly linked lists, a list where each element is a node containing data and a pointer to the next node. You can only traverse this type of list one way, hence its name.

Here's the general structure (in pseudocode) of a singly linked list:
```
node {
     type: data;
     node: next;
}
```
