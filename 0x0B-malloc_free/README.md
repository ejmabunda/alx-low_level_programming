# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

This project explores the concept of memory allocation: `malloc` and `free`
- `malloc` is a function used to allocate a certain amount of memory during program execution.
- `free` is a function used to deallocate or free previously allocated memory.

## How to use:
`str = malloc(sizeof(char) * 3)` will create a space in memory of 3 bytes. `Use free(str)` to free up/deallocate this space.
